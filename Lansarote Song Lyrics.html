  <h1>"Sugar"</h1>
  <p>by: Maroon 5</p>
  <p>I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
    I need your loving, loving
    I need it now
    When I'm without you
    I'm something weak
    You got me begging, begging
    I'm on my knees</p>
    
<p> I don't wanna be needing your love
    I just wanna be deep in your love
    And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby
    'Cause I really don't care where you are
    I just wanna be there where you are
    And I gotta get one little taste</p> 
    
<p> Your sugar
    Yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me?
    I'm right here, 'cause I need
    Little love, a little sympathy
    Yeah, you show me good loving
    Make it alright
    Need a little sweetness in my life
    Your sugar
    Yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me?</p> 
    
    
<p> My broken pieces
    You pick them up
    Don't leave me hanging, hanging
    Come give me some
    When I'm without ya
    I'm so insecure
    You are the one thing, one thing
    I'm living for</p>
    
<p> I don't wanna be needing your love
    I just wanna be deep in your love
    And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby
    'Cause I really don't care where you are
    I just wanna be there where you are
    And I gotta get one little taste</p> 
    
<p> Your sugar
    Yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me?
    I'm right here
    'Cause I need
    Little love, a little sympathy
    Yeah, you show me good loving
    Make it alright
    Need a little sweetness in my life

<p> Yeah
    I want that red velvet
    I want that sugar sweet
    Don't let nobody touch it
    Unless that somebody's me
    I gotta be your man
    There ain't no other way
    'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California day</p>
    
<p> I don't wanna play no games
    You don't gotta be afraid
    Don't give me all that shy shit
    No make-up on
    That's my</p>
