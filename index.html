  <h1>"Sugar"</h1>
  <p>by: Maroon 5</p>
  <p>I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down</p>
   <p> I need your loving, loving</p>
   <p> I need it now</p>
  <p>When I'm without you</p>
   <p> I'm something weak</p>
   <p> You got me begging, begging</p>
   <p> I'm on my knees</p>
    
<p> I don't wanna be needing your love</p>
  <p>   I just wanna be deep in your love</p>
  <p>   And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby</p>
   <p>  'Cause I really don't care where you are</p>
  <p>   I just wanna be there where you are</p>
   <p>  And I gotta get one little taste</p> 
    
<p> Your sugar</p>
  <p>   Yes, please</p>
  <p>   Won't you come and put it down on me?</p>
   <p>  I'm right here, 'cause I need</p>
   <p>  Little love, a little sympathy</p>
   <p>  Yeah, you show me good loving</p>
   <p>  Make it alright</p>
   <p>  Need a little sweetness in my life</p>

   <p>  Don't leave me hanging, hanging</p>
   <p>  Come give me some</p>
   <p> When I'm without ya</p>
   <p>  I'm so insecure</p>
   <p>  You are the one thing, one thing</p>
   <p>  I'm living for</p>
    
<p> I don't wanna be needing your love</p>
  <p>   I just wanna be deep in your love</p>
